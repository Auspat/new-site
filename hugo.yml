    Title: "About Me"
    Content: Hello and welcome to my portfolio site. My name is Austin, and I am a senior studying Computer Science and German at the University of Arkansas. I am currently in an exchange program at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, and I am looking for internships in the United States or Germany in the field of Video Game Development for the months March 2024 - July 2024. Below, you will find how to contact me as well as a portfolio of my past and current projects.
          I am a lifelong learner and constantly seek opportunities to grow and adapt to the ever-evolving industry landscape. My approach is rooted in learning new technologies and ways to connect virtually, and I am committed to making the best meaningful games for future generations to enjoy.
