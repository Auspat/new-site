## Projects from Game Design I and II 

I learned many valuable game design skills from these projects such as ***Scripting***, creating ***Animations***, modifying in-game ***Physics***, designing ***UI/UX Designs***, ***Version Control***, creating ***Shaders***, ***Asset Management***, working with ***NavMesh*** and ***Terrain Generation***, ***Sound Design***, optimizing the game for ***Minimal Lag***, formulating a ***Design Document***, and developing a solid ***Foundation in Unity 3D***.

## Project 1: ***Calypso's Dating Sim***

- **Description:** This was my first Unity project I worked on, and I learned all about the basics of game mechanics, timers, win/lose conditions, colliders, and UI/UX implementation. I go more into the story and gameplay in my video!
- **Code and Software:** (photo of code timers/points conditions)**!!!**
- **Links:** [Design Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wiDwkc-ctDMuHqEkdKGQ55_R4emfkmaT/view?usp=share_link), [Play the Game](https://auspatgames.itch.io/5-nights-at-calypsos-dating-simulator) <-- This game is fairly small so I was able to get it to play on itch.io, which uses WebGL to run games on the web.

## Project 2: ***Escape From Cerce's***

- **Description:** To make this game, I experimented with Unity's built in terrain generation tools to create an island home to the troublesome witch Cerce. I designed clues that would guide the player (Odysseus) through the map and help him find the secret ingredient that would cure his lost crewmates. This game also required logic that would only activate the next clue on the map if the previous clue was found.
- **Code and Software:** (show unity terrain generation/show code logic) **!!!**

## Project 3: ***Argos: Death has Passed***

- **Description:** This was my first group project I was a part of, and I was in charge of linking everybody's work together and designing the UI. This was an unusual task because we had not learned version control yet, so I was grabbing and combining code and assets that were not initially designed to work together. I had to be creative in my methods, so I learned how to transfer game characters from one game to the other by changing the main camera and input system to work for a specific character. I also worked with invisible colliders that would activate the next sequence in the game. Overall, I would say the story of this game was the best so far, and I geuninely enjoyed working with other talented artist and game designers on this project. 
- **Code and Software:** (Show colliders that change player view)**!!**
- **Link:** [Design Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hSJFIfPMnX2mOvqyHb5PhRPGTSRvK6oZ/view?usp=share_link) <-- Shows the plan my team and I had for creating this game

## Project 4: ***German Final***

- **Description:** This game was inspired by 4 works of German literature, and features dialogue options between the player and npcs. Different outcomes would occur in the game depending on your dialogue choices. I also learned how to traverse the Unity Asset store for free FX like fire and fireworks, as well as useful building assets like houses and castles. This enhanced the story, by making the player feel like they were a part of these books. 
- **Code and Software:** (Show Dialogue Options Code/Show Assets and fire) **!!!**

## Project 5: ***Changed***

- **Description:** This was one of my favorite projects to work on because I got to design and implement one of my favorite parts about games: powerups. _Changed_ is a game about the grotesque transformation of Daphne into a wooden chair as she is trying to escape her perpetrator Apollo. The wooden chair must now find a way to escape the house, by collecting powerups that "change" the wooden chair's form. I had a good time creating the powerups for the chair as well as creating the level design for this eerie puzzle escape room.
- **Code and Software:** (Powerups Code and Level Design photos) **!!!**

## Project 6: ***The Boss's Web***

- **Description:** This game was all about a humble office worker's attempt the break free from his dead-end job. He unlocks the metaphorical gun of creativity and must use that to fight his boss and free his coworkers! I worked on Scene Management and on the boss stage in this game, where I learned how to create a spray-paint-like weapon, a NavMesh, and work with enemy animations that trigger whenever they get "freed."
- **Code and Software:** (Scene Management code, NavMesh coworker code, gun development and sound, animation photo) **!!!**
